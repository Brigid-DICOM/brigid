## Execution Steps

Brigid provides a single executable version, which you can download from the [Releases](https://github.com/Brigid-DICOM/brigid/releases) page.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Download the single executable file

        Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Brigid-DICOM/brigid/releases) page, and download the single executable file.

        <Callout title="Note">
            If you want to use the system JRE, you can download the version without JRE, and you must ensure the following:
            - Put the OpenCV libraries in the `lib` (windows is `bin`) directory of the JRE, you can refer to [Manual Configuration of OpenCV Libraries](#manual-configuration-of-opencv-libraries)
            - Java version >= 17
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Extract the files
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Run

        Run the `brigid-server` file to start the Brigid service

        Then, open `http://localhost:3119` to enter the Brigid system
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual Configuration of OpenCV Libraries

If you choose the version **without an embedded JRE**, you must manually configure the required OpenCV libraries; otherwise, some features may not function properly.

### Windows

- Copy `data/dcm4che/lib/windows-x86-64/opencv_java.dll` to the `bin` directory of the JRE

### Linux

- Copy `data/dcm4che/lib/linux-x86-64/libclib_jiio.so` and `data/dcm4che/lib/linux-x86-64/libopencv_java.so` to the `lib` directory of the JRE

### macOS

- Copy `data/dcm4che/lib/macosx-x86-64/*libopencv_java.dylib` to the `lib` directory of the JRE
