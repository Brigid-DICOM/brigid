## 📄 DICOM Management Features

Brigid supports comprehensive DICOM image management, including retrieval, access, and deletion.

## 📂 Intuitive Hierarchical Management

Brigid organizes images according to the DICOM standard into `Study` → `Series` → `Instance` levels. Just like using folders, you can start from a patient's single exam and dive into each image detail.

## 🖼️ Customized View Layouts

You can freely switch between layouts based on your current needs:
- Table mode: List presentation, data clear at a glance.
- Card mode: Visual preview, quickly lock the image.
